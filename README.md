# Conda Community Website

This repository will define the conda community website, which will reside at conda.org.  Our aim is for this website to be a gathering place for the conda community, and the default place people go when they have questions or are looking for information.

We mean "community" in the broadest possible sense, including users of conda and other tools in the ecosystem, package and tool writers, and infrastucure and channel managers.  "Other tools" includes anything written by anyone that ties into the conda ecosystem.

## Get Involved!

This is very much a work in progress.  Work originally started on this in 2021, but then went on hiatus and did not start again in earnest until August 2022.

We have formed several teams to help us move this project forward (see below).  If you are interested in any (or all!) of these areas then please join the relevant teams.
